My app has 2 screens, the main one being the one that appears on launch. It
contains 2 labels, 4 coloured buttons and 2 other buttons (Play and High
Scores). The game can be played by tapping the Play button or any of the
coloured buttons. Doing so will cause Simon to go, showing the player which
buttons to press next. This is indicated by a white square that appears around
each button when pressed. Every time the player successfully copies Simon, it
will go again and so on. During Simonâ€™s turn, the player cannot press any of the
coloured buttons.

When the player successfully completes a pattern, their score will increase by
the length of the pattern and a new one will be generated with 5 more items. If
the player fails to repeat the pattern, their current score will be recorded if it is
above 0 and a new pattern of the same length will be generated. The high
scores table contains a maximum of 20 items so the score will only be added if
there is space/it is greater than at least one of the values currently in the table.

The high scores screen can be accessed via the High Scores button and can be
dismissed by dragging down. It displays the 20 highest high scores and the
date they were achieved in a tableView.
